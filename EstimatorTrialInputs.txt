Jelly Bean Estimator Inputs



To make sure the first test I wrote is working:
	
set_world_pop(7 billion) --> should produce error message because not an integer.
 correct would be set_world_pop(7000000000) --> no error message



To make sure second test I wrote works:
	
set_world_pop(-40000) --> should produce error message because 
number of people cannot be a negative value.



To make sure third test I wrote works:
	
set_frac_ppl_loving_pink(67%) --> should produce error message because fraction of people who love pink should be a float

To make sure fourth test I wrote works:
set_frac_pppl_loving_pink(67.0) --> should produce error message because fraction of people who love pink should be between 0.0 and 1.0.
